# Document Order and Delivery System

This project is the 1st prize-winning solution at HackNU 2023 hackathon, aimed at streamlining the process of ordering and delivering official documents for the NC Government Corporation.

## Overview

This web-app facilitates the easy ordering and delivery of official documents such as national ID cards, proof of estate, and more. It incorporates three primary user roles: User, Courier, and Document Center Employee.

## Features

- **User Role**: Users can order official documents conveniently.
- **Courier Role**: Couriers manage the delivery process from the Document Center to the User.
- **Document Center Employee Role**: Employees handle document validation, preparation, and handover to Couriers.

An additional feature is the implementation of an ML-based face recognition system that bolsters user authentication, thus increasing the security of the system.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our gratitude to the NC Government Corporation for presenting this challenge. Our team is honored to have had the opportunity to develop a solution that simplifies the process of document ordering and delivery.
